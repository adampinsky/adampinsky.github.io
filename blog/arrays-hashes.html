            The tools that Ruby has for handling collections or sets of information, <span>Arrays</span> & <span>Hashes</span>, are very dynamic, and powerful in their versatility.  To understand <span>what</span> they are, we'll first discuss their similarities.  However, their power is not in how they're alike. So, to learn <span>how</span> to use them, I'll point out what makes them different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hashes and Arrays are tools used to bundle and organize related bits of information into lists for easy storage and reference.  Being lists, they share the quality of being iterable, and most of the methods that come with that quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            An array is an ordered list of information. Meaning that, the order of the items within the list in relation to each other is significant to the program and maintained.  This quality of arrays is what allows us to control the order of it's element for specific referencing. Arrays can hold any data type. (i.e. Strings, Fixnum, Floats, Bools, Arrays, & Hashes)
          </p>
          <p>
            A hash is a collection of <span>key</span>/<span>value</span> pairs.  The <span>key</span> is either a string name pointing to its <span>value</span> (<code>"key" => "value"</code>), or better yet a Symbol which points to a value (<code>key: "value"</code>).  The location of each <span>key</span>/<span>value</span> pair in relation to one another within the hash, is insignificant to the program and unreliable. Therefore, in order to accurately access any one of the different values within a hash you just  reference the paired <span>key</span> name.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might be helpful if you think of all arrays as if they are specialized hashes.  Since, with arrays, order matters, it's as if an array is a hash with built-in, numerical ordered keys beginning always with 0.  However you think about it, you're sure to find arrays and hashes as invaluable tools.

I liked this process. Granted, it was super short, uncomplicated, but still....
I'll add more to this reflection if time permits.
