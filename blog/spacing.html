            If you are a 'thing' that exisits, then you most certainly occupy space. As Human 'things' we have some ability to manipulate our own spaces to better suit our individual needs. For instance, some human 'things' will stand-up straight and tall with their sholders squared and thier chest out.efffectively communicating it's importance to other Human 'things' by subtly increasing the amount of space it occupies. Similarly, a web designer can use space in various ways to communicate qualities of all of the webpages's 'things', known as elements, to the user visiting the website. Every element has at least 3 root properties that effect the amount space that 'thing' occupies. They are <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code>.  Yes, its true that many web 'things' have additional space altering properties, but these 3 properties are common amongst all 'things'. "What roles do margin, border, and padding play in spacing? And, how do I know when to use which one?", I hear you ask. Well I'll tell you.

            As illistrated in <em>fig. 1</em> on the right, the content of every element is surrounded by a margin, enclosed in a border, and inflated with padding. Both the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> property values can be specificaly set in <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, <code>cm</code>, <code>%</code> or with either of the keywords <code>auto</code>, <code>initial</code>, <code>inherit</code>. Personally, I find it helpful when concidering <code>margin</code>s, <code>border</code>s, and <code>padding</code>.to think of web 'things' as human 'things'. An individual's personality, values and beliefs, memories, and skills are all some of the qualities that make up a human "thing's" content; it's conribution to the overall design. Content is packaged within <code>padding</code>. <code>Padding</code> is often use in the same way humans will use stature and body language as a means of pulling focus towards themselves or to help them blend in with the crowd.  More importantly, <code>padding</code> gives bulk and substance. And, like a human shedding bodyweight, removing or adding <code>padding</code> directly effects the shape and size of the element. Though more comfortable in the buff than the typical human, web elements may don themselves a <code>border</code> as a means of self-expression and individualization. Like a Sumo in Spanx, the <code>border</code> encircles the <code>padding</code>outlining and defining the overall shape of the element. The size of content, along with the measurments of the <code>padding</code>, and <code>border</code> add up to equal the amount of space nessacary for the element to display without overflow. <code>Margin</code>s make up the shared space between elements.  Like a buffer zone of comfort known to humans as the "personal bubble".  Humans, when among other humans of similar content, will come together, clustering into tightknit groups. Or, how a primadonna must clear the stage so as to pull the maximum amount atttention. These behaviors are mirrored in way navigational buttons are spaced tightly together to emphisize their shared purpose. But, as a group, they're often granted thier own dedicated space signifying their importance, and, in so doing, making them easier to find on the page.
