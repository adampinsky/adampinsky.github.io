          If you are a 'thing' that exisits, then you most certainly occupy space. As Human 'things' we have some ability to manipulate our own spaces to better suit our individual needs. For instance, some human 'things' will stand-up straight and tall with their sholders squared and thier chest out.efffectively communicating it's importance to other Human 'things' by subtly increasing the amount of space it occupies. Similarly, a web designer can use space in various ways to communicate qualities of all of the webpages's 'things', known as elements, to the user visiting the website.
          Every element has at least 3 root properties that effect the amount space that 'thing' occupies. They are <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code>.  Yes, its true that many web 'things' have additional space altering properties, but these 3 properties are common amongst all 'things'. "What roles do margin, border, and padding play in spacing? And, how do I know when to use which one?", I hear you ask. Well I'll tell you.
