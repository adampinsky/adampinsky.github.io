            Have you ever played one of those "Find the Differences" games? You're given two seemingly identical images placed side by side for you to scrutinize.  And, it is your task to discover and pinpoint the 5 or so minute discrepancies between the two versions of the same photo.  If you weren't the one that made those changes, than it can be very difficult to find those errors.  You might even swear to have discovered a difference where one does not in fact exist.  
            Using a Version Control System (VCS) such as Git to track the changes you make in project files as you work away is thorough, archival, and collaborative. Consider, again, that photo searching game. The "save\save as" file system would be akin to starting with the original photo, then replacing it with the a new clean, edited version and expected to play with only the new image and your memory to go off of.  With VCS and Git you not only have a version of the photo as it was before the edits still on hand for you to reference, but the new version of the photo has all the edits circled for you.  It doesn't make for the most entertaining game, true; but it sure as hell makes debugging a project a bit smoother.
