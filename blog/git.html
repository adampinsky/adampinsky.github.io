        Have you ecer played one of those "Find the Differences" games? You're given two seemingly identical images placed side by side for you to scrutinize.  And, it is your task to discover and pinpoint the 5 or so minute Photoshoped discrepencies between the two versions of the same photo.  If you weren't the one that made those changes, than it can be very difficult to find those errors.  You might even swear to have discovered a difference where one does not in fact exist.  
        Using a Version Control System (VCS) like Git to track the changes you make while writting code is akin to having cheatsheet of your photo with all of the differences circled for you to referance. Acctually, it's even more spacific. Instead of having to save and print a whole copy of the picture every time a new error is created, or an existing error is altered, Git provides a log containing the locations of the individual changes as well as a descrption of the before and after of that location.
